## About Me
I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for actionable analytics. Currently pursuing my Master's at Monash University. I blend statistical thinking with tools like pandas, scikit-learn, and ArcGIS to solve real-world problems. 

## Featured Projects
Focus on what I've built—code, visuals, and impact.

### AI-Powered Pandemic Early Detection System
*Monash University | April–May 2025*  
Designed an innovative AI framework for early outbreak spotting using multi-modal data (social media trends, wastewater, mobility).  
- Analyzed CDC FluView data in R (dplyr, ggplot2) → Achieved ~80% sensitivity in anomaly detection.  
- Proposed AWS cloud deployment and freemium business model for scalability.  
- Earned Distinction for novelty—full proposal and presentation delivered.
